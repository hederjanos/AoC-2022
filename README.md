# Advent of Code 2022

This is my first AoC series which I follow in time. My goals are practicing, learning and following the event in time as far as I can.
I try to solve the challenges according to oop principles (depth depends on my mood) on the day of publication written in Java using jdk 11.

If I can't solve a challenge in a couple of days, I'll get an idea from web.
